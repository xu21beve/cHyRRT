# Hybrid Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (HyRRT)

**Motion Planning** is a computational problem that involves finding a sequence of valid configurations to move the robot from the source to the destination. 

This repository provides the implementation of **HyRRT** in C++, compatible with OMPL and ROS 2 Humble. The theory analysis can be found at [motion-planning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9992444). Furthermore, we provide a [MATLAB](https://github.com/HybridSystemsLab/hybridRRT) version, without compatibility with OMPL and ROS.

**Your stars, forks and PRs are welcome!**

## <span id="0">0. Quick Start

*Tested on ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS with ROS Humble.*

1. Install [OMPL](https://ompl.kavrakilab.org/installation.html).

2. Install git.
    ```bash
    sudo apt install git
    ```

3. Install [ROS 2](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html) (Humble recommended, but later versions like Iron may also work.)

4. Clone the reposity.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/xu21beve/cHyRRT.git
    ```


5. Setup CMake Build Directory
  **Note: 
   Open your terminal and navigate to the root folder of this repository. Then, create a new directory called 'Build' and set it as your build directory using CMake. You can do this using the following commands:
   ```
   cd <path-to-your-root-directory>
   mkdir Build
   cd Build
   cmake ..
   ```

2. Build the Project

   Once the CMake files have been generated in the `Build` directory, you can compile all the source files into executables using the `make` command:
   ```
   make
   ```

3. Run the Executables

   Now, you can run the generated executable files located in the `Build/test` folder. You can do this using the following commands:

   - For the Bouncing Ball test, navigate to the project root directory and execute the `bouncing_ball` executable as follows:
     ```
     cd ..
     ./Build/test/bouncing_ball
     ```

   - For the multicopter example, execute the `multicopter` executable as follows:
     ```
     ./Build/test/multicopter
     ```

    > NOTE: Modifying launch files may not have any effect, because they are regenerated by a Python script based on `src/user_config/user_config.yaml` when you run `main.sh`. Therefore, you should modify configurations in `user_config.yaml` instead of launch files.

***Optional:***

7. Use ROS RViz2 to visualize the path.

  - For the bouncing ball or multicopter examples:
    ```
     ./Build/test/visualize
    ```

    ***Include different version for different Operating Systems...***

## 1. <span id="1">Document

The overall file structure is shown below.
```
/root_directory
├── HyRRT.h
├── yourOtherFiles.cpp
└── src

    └── yourSrcFiles.cpp
```

To better understand the project code, detailed interface documentation can be generated using the doxygen tool. First install doxygen and graphviz.

```bash
sudo apt-get install doxygen graphviz
```

Then start the doxygen and you can find the documentation in `./docs/html/index.html`. 

```bash
doxygen
```
